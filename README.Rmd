Examining CTE SQL queries can be cumbersome, what with the commenting out, copy-pasting, and re-selecting. cteviewer brings the intermediate CTE expressions into R for easier access and further scrutiny. Invoke the Rstudio add-ins to bring the expressions into your environment as a list or as View() tabs. See screenshot below.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cteviewer like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("daranzolin/cteviewer")
```

## Example

The following data and query were taken from [dbt-labs Jaffle Shop repo.](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop)

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(cteviewer)
library(DBI)
library(readr)

orders <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop/main/seeds/raw_orders.csv")
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
dbWriteTable(con, "orders", orders)
dbDisconnect(con)
```

In the following example, I have `query.sql` open in RStudio:

```{sql eval = FALSE}
with import_orders as (

    select *
    from orders

),
aggregate_orders as (

    select
        user_id,
        count(user_id) as count_orders

    from import_orders
    where status not in ('returned', 'return pending')
    group by 1

),
segment_users as (

    select *,
        case
            when count_orders >= 3 then 'super_buyer'
            when count_orders <3 and count_orders >= 2 then
                'regular_buyer'
            else 'single_buyer'
        end as buyer_type

    from aggregate_orders

)
select * from segment_users
```

Now I can invoke the add-ins:

'CTE to List' returns a list:

```{r echo = FALSE}
cte_dfs <- list(import_orders = structure(list(id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
